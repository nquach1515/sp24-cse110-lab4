    A. '32' because '3' is a string and we add 2 to a string.
    B. 1 because we can't substract strings. '3' is mapped to its integer counterpart.
    C. 3 because null is just 0.
    D. 3null because '3' is a string, so we add null as a string to it.
    E. 4 because 3 is an integer and true is just 1.
    F. 0 because false and null are both 0.
    G. 3undefined because '3' is a string and we just add undefined as a string to it.
    H. NaN because 3 is a number, but you can't subtract undefined from a string or a number.

14. 
    A. true because we covert '2' to an integer and the integer 2 is greater than the integer 1.
    B. false beacuse we compare each digit when it is a string. '2' is not less than '1'.
    C. true because we convert '2' to an integer and 2 is equal to 2.
    D. false because the === comparitor checks for both value and type.
    E. false because true is equal to 1 and 1 != 2.
    F. true because Boolean(2) is equal to true and true == true

15. The == operator attempts to convert the two values to a common type if they aren't the same type. Then, it will comapre the values if it can find a common type. The === operator checks if the two values are the same type first. Then if they are, it checks the actual values of the two values.

17. The result will be [2, 4, 6]. The function is basically multiplying each value inside of array by 2. It calls the multiply by 2 function on each value and pushes it in to the new array.

19. The output of the code above is as follows:
    1. 1
    2. 4
    3. 3
    4. 2
